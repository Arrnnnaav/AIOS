# Tracked follow-ups

Small items deliberately deferred rather than forgotten. Each says what it is,
why it was not blocking, and what it would cost to leave.

## From perception tier 2 (merged 429a85e, 2026-08-19)

### 1. Merge-cap test counts words, not parts
`tests/test_ocr_reassembly.py::test_at_most_three_reads_merge_into_one_candidate`
asserts `len(read.text.split()) <= 3`, but `MERGE_MAX_PARTS` caps PARTS. The two
coincide only because that fixture uses single-word reads. A merge of three
multi-word reads would exceed three words and the test would not notice. The cap
itself is enforced in code and covered by the geometry tests, so this is a gap in
one assertion rather than in the behaviour. (Ruling P3.)

### 2. Vestigial parenthesised import in `run.py`
A single-name import wrapped in parentheses, left over from an earlier edit.
Cosmetic.

### 3. `_tier2_payload()` spends a run on a failed walk
Placement is correct — a raising UIA walk cannot suppress OCR — but publication is
gated on the walk having succeeded. So on a raising walk the OCR read happens, the
one-shot `grounded` flag is consumed and a fruitless run is spent from the budget,
and the result is discarded unpublished. Wasteful rather than wrong; the caps still
bound it. Documented accurately in FLOW.md.

### 4. Cancellation is a UI-thread convention, not worker-enforced
Absence of a `Tier2Request` means "not wanted", and the UI thread must cancel on
grounding success and at every step boundary. A future driver that forgets to
cancel reintroduces the defect where an abandoned step's request is serviced
forever (found and fixed as finding 1 of the threading review). The worker cannot
enforce it because it does not know the current step.

### 5. `test_persistence_e2e` allows rung 2 or 3 where FLOW says rung 2
FLOW.md states the second process grounds at rung 2; the test accepts rung 2 or 3.
One of the two should be tightened.

## Separate milestone, already scoped

### Chromium warm-up retry
Electron apps are blind-until-asked, not blind: Chromium enables its accessibility
tree on demand and the first UIA probe switches it on. A first walk returning window
furniture but no document content is NOT-YET-READY rather than empty, and currently
reads as a successful observation. Cheaper than OCR and fixes a real bug. Deliberately
excluded from tier 2 — see the tier-2 design doc section 1.

## Deferred infrastructure — revisit on a second occurrence

### Mechanical enforcement of D032 and D034
Both are currently rules that rely on being read. Real teeth would be a pre-commit
hook scanning documentation for figures with no cited source (D034), and the SDD
skill refusing to mark controller-authored work complete without an independent
read (D032).

Deliberately NOT built yet. One occurrence of a failure shape justifies writing the
rule down; it does not yet justify the build cost of automating enforcement. The
trigger for revisiting is a SECOND incident of this specific shape — evidence
laundering, a number entering the record with no durable source — as distinct from
ordinary documentation drift, which D032 already covers and which has occurred many
times. Do not count drift incidents toward this trigger; they are the other failure.
